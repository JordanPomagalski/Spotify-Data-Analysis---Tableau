Visualisations demonstrating relationships between genre, type, and popularity

I created a chart to determine the most popular genres on average.

And then utilised a scatter plot to establish a positive correlation between songs that have a high danceability metric and high popularity.

Then, using a mix of filters and context filters, I created a chart of the most popular artists within the five most popular genres, and also where their average danceability is high. I utilised a dynamic filter to be able to update the results for specific genres.

An interactive version of my dashboard is available on [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/views/PopularDanceableMusic/DanceMusicPopularity?:language=en-GB&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).
